                R large than (N + M) * 4 * 2 is always true when N and M >= 1.
                Obviously, N + M <= N * M < 3 * N * M, when N >=2 and M >=2,
                           N + 1 < 3 * N, when N or M is 1.

            When using FP16, we can reduce:

        So do the 'giou' (large than 'iou').

        Time-wise, FP16 is generally faster than FP32.

        When gpu_assign_thr is not -1, it takes more time on cpu
        but not reduce memory.
        There, we can reduce half the memory and keep the speed.
